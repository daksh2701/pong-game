# 🕹️ Pong Game in Python

A classic Pong game built using Python's `turtle` graphics module. This project demonstrates object-oriented programming, collision detection, and real-time game mechanics in a clean, modular structure.

## 🚀 Features

- Two-player paddle control (W/S for left, Up/Down for right)
- Ball movement with realistic bounce physics
- Collision detection with walls and paddles
- Score tracking and display
- Automatic ball reset on paddle miss
- Gradual speed increase for added challenge

## 🎮 Controls

| Player | Key Up | Key Down |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Left   | `W`    | `S`      |
| Right  | `↑`    | `↓`      |

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- `turtle` module (comes pre-installed with Python)
- Optional: Set `TCL_LIBRARY` and `TK_LIBRARY` paths if using custom Python installation on Windows

**##🧠 Concepts Demonstrated- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- Event-driven input handling
- Real-time animation with screen.tracer()
- Modular code design for scalability
